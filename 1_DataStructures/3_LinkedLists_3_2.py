# 3.2 Add two linked lists that represent numbers
'''
We can represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number.
The nodes are connected in reverse order,such that the number 54321 is represented by the following
linked list:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 
Given two linked lists in this format,return their sum.
For example,given:

9->9
5->2

You should return 124=99+25 as :
4-> 2-> 1
